# Learning R for Machine Learning

Welcome to my repository where I document my learning journey in R for Machine Learning. Here, you will find all the R scripts and related files that I have created and used throughout my learning process.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following folders:

- **Data**: Contains datasets used in the projects.
- **Scripts**: R scripts for different machine learning algorithms and data processing tasks.
- **Notebooks**: R Markdown files and Jupyter notebooks for detailed walkthroughs and experiments.
- **Models**: Saved models and results from training and evaluation.

## Getting Started

To get started with the code in this repository, you'll need to have R and RStudio installed on your machine. You can download them from the following links:

- [R](https://cran.r-project.org/)
- [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

### Cloning the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arpitpatelsitapur/Learning-R-For-ML.git
```


## Learning Progress

I will be updating this repository regularly as I learn new concepts and techniques. Here are some of the topics covered so far:

1. Data Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Supervised Learning Algorithms
    - Linear Regression
    - Logistic Regression
    - Decision Trees
    - Random Forests
    - Support Vector Machines
4. Unsupervised Learning Algorithms
    - K-Means Clustering
    - Hierarchical Clustering
5. Model Evaluation and Hyperparameter Tuning
